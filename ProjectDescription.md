# Car Sales and Service Dashboards  

This project was completed as part of the **IBM Data Visualization and Dashboards with Excel and Cognos** course. I analyzed car sales and service data and created interactive dashboards using **Google Looker Studio** to showcase insights effectively.  

## Project Overview  
The goal of this project was to analyze car dealership data and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) related to sales and service.  

### Dashboards Created  
#### **Sales Dashboard**  
- **Profit (in millions)**: Highlighted the total profit.  
- **Quantity Sold**: Displayed the total number of units sold.  
- **Quantity Sold by Model**: Bar chart comparing sales by car models.  
- **Average Quantity Sold**: Showcased average sales figures.  
- **Profit by Dealer ID**: Column chart sorted in ascending order.  

#### **Service Dashboard**  
- **Recalls per Model**: Column chart displaying recall trends.  
- **Customer Sentiment**: Treemap comparing positive, neutral, and negative reviews.  
- **Cars Sold vs. Profit**: Combo chart analyzing monthly trends.  
- **Recalls by Model and System**: Heatmap identifying outliers.  

## Tools and Skills  
- **Google Looker Studio**: Designed and built interactive dashboards.  
- **Excel**: Used for data preparation and analysis.  
- **Data Visualization**: Created meaningful visual representations of data.  
- **Data Analysis**: Derived insights from raw data.  

## Repository Files  
- `Vasatika_CarSalesByModelEnd.xlsx`: Final Excel file containing pivot tables and charts.  
- `Vasatika_Car_Sales_Service_Dashboard.pdf`: PDF version of the exported dashboard report from Google Looker Studio.
